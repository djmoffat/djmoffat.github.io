In this talk, we will provide an overview of Machine Learning (ML) and it's uses in Earth Observation (EO). This talk will introduce the concepts of AI and ML, with the aim of explaining the differences and the fundamental approaches that can be taken in the field, with some simple examples. We will then go on to discuss a variety of different potential approaches than can be taken, and how ML can be used to overcome some consistent challenges in EO, and where it is not necessarily appropriate to use.
