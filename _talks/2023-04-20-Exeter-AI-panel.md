I was a panel member at the opening of the inaugaral Machine Learning for Earth Observation Remote Sensing with the Environment Intelligence Network workshop at University of Exeter. The panel discussed example of how machine learning can enhance Earth observation science, emerging trend in AI or machine learning that are particularly exciting, the greatest challenges of using machine learning for Earth Observation studies, ethical and societal considerations associated with using AI and machine learning for Earth observation and future research priorities in using AI and machine learning for remote sensing in Earth observation science.
